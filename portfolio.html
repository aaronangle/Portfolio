                    <p>This website was created by myself and three other individuals. A user can enter in any
                        ingredients that they have readily available and our website will provide recipes that they are
                        able to make from the ingredients. Users are also able to search by recipe names to find things
                        that they want to cook. The site makes a call to the Edamam API based on user input to obtain
                        the data that is rendered to the page.</p>

                        forecast for the next five days. Searches are stored in the local storage so users can easily
                        jump between cities that have already been searched for.</p>
