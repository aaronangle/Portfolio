                    <p>This website was created by myself and three other individuals. A user can enter in any
                        ingredients that they have readily available and our website will provide recipes that they are
                        able to make from the ingredients. Users are also able to search by recipe names to find things
                        that they want to cook. The site makes a call to the Edamam API based on user input to obtain
                        the data that is rendered to the page.</p>

                    <p>This employee search directory was built using React. It makes a call to the random user api to
                        get mock data to display to the user. The app displays a user profile picture, name, date of
                        birth, and phone number. There is an option to search which will filter through the users data
                        and return the users that you search for. There is also an option to alphabetically sort the
                        users by name.A regular expression is used to help find the name that is being searched. This
                        was built using only React hooks. This site is deployed on the free tier of Heroku so it might
                        take a few seconds to spin up.</p>
